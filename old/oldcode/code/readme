analysis.ipynb is where you made a bunch of nicely formatted plots
for a presentation

old contains old code

cedar contains code meant to be run on the cluster
it has gillespie simulation code, bash scripts to run these in parallel on 
different nodes, and burial time analysis codes

reverting.py  contains the raw code to perform the gillespie simulations

tail_study.ipynb is where you first computed the unconditional resting time
cdf and found that it is a truncated pareto distribution in accord with 
Bradley 2017 


Since writing the earlier portion of this readme you made a lot of progress. 
You did high resolution simulations on the HPC cluster (cedar, later graham),
and so the real code is re-written and contained in the graham folder. 
There are readmes distributed throughout that.
