Simulation:

trial.py runs a single trial given flags which fix l value and flow condition
" runone.sh x y "  submits a " python3 trial.py x y " job
" ./iterator.sh "  submits " runone.sh x y " repeatedly over all x and y 

The code for trial.py is contained in reverting.py

you may need to run ./iterate.sh as ./iterate.sh | bash - 
which makes a new bash shell for each iteration
I think there is a problem with this script. Some jobs get missed in the 
submission



Analysis: 

analysis_tools.py contains functions to compute the distribution of elevation
return times at each elevation, and to convolve these conditions to get the
unconditional waiting time distribution

analyze.py iterates through every simulation result, computes the return time
cdf for this simulation, and saves it in a new directory which it makes.
It will also save 'bins' which is the set of times over which the cdf is 
defined.
